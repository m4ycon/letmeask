# üè≠ How to install/use

This section describes how to run this app locally at your environment, of course you can access the deployed version [here](https://letmeask-19e44.web.app/). For this you need to have `node` and `git` installed.

If you have `yarn` installed, you can replace `npm`. Open `cmd` and:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/m4ycon/letmeask.git
$ cd proffy/web
$ npm install
```

After this, you will need to set up your environment by creating a file `.env.local` at the root of your repository. Complete `...` with the respective `api_key`, `auth_domain`, ..., your firebase configuration.

```
# Firebase config
REACT_APP_API_KEY='...'
REACT_APP_AUTH_DOMAIN='...'
REACT_APP_DATABASE_URL='...'
REACT_APP_PROJECT_ID='...'
REACT_APP_STORAGE_BUCKET='...'
REACT_APP_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID='...'
REACT_APP_APP_ID='...'
```
And finally you can run `$ npm start` and access the app on `http://localhost:3000`



Happy hacking!
